# music-downloader
Work in progress script to help me automate my music collection process<br/><br/>
Planned:
* Pass through mp3 gain normalizer [MP3gain](http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net) (I currently use [wxmp3gain](https://github.com/cfgnunes/wxmp3gain) manually per song)
* Add search functionality for easier link grabbing from both Youtube and Spotify
* General UI improvements
